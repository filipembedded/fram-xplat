# F-RAM (Ferroelectric RAM)

FRAM memory is a standalone non-volatile memory that enables instant data capture in cases when power is interrupted. This type of memory is ideal for mission-critical data logging applications:
- Automotive
- Military
- PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers)
- Medical devices

FRAM offers "instant" non-volatility and "unlimited" endurance without compromising on speed or energy efficiency. It is byte-addresable, which makes it very flexible.
