# F-RAM (Ferroelectric RAM)

FRAM (Ferroelectric Random Access Memory) is a type of non-volatile memory that combines the speed and endurance of SRAM with the non-volatility of Flash or EEPROM. Unlike traditional Flash memory, FRAM can retain data without power and can be written to virtually unlimited times without degradation. This type of memory is ideal for mission-critical data logging applications:
- Automotive
- Military
- PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers)
- Medical devices

FRAM offers "instant" non-volatility and "unlimited" endurance without compromising on speed or energy efficiency. It is byte-addresable, making it very flexible and easy to integrate into systems that require frequent and reliable data updates.
